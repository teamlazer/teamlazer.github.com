h2. Team Lazer: FREE!

We recently had a thought. (Rare, I know). 

There's a lot of people out there that have one or more of:

* A non-profit that needs a [new] website, but no money.
* A great idea for a useful web application/site, but no resources.
* An existing app that is failing because of poor or sloppy code, but no way to fix it.

We want to help. 
FOR FREE.

For one day a month, Team Lazer (@aq and @mrb_bk) and friends will pick a project from the pool of applicants and work our asses off to build/fix/hack and get something launched. Once the project is launched we'll post the source code (cleaned of private information) on github. 

h3. The Workflow

# Apply.
# Select.
# Talk/Spec.
# Hack.
# Launch.
# Open-source.
